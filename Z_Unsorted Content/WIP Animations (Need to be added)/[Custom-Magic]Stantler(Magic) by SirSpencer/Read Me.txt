The animation used song track 3331, the Gorgan scream, to call the Stantler battle cry
For the animation to sound correct, replace that with the audio file. 
If you don't want you replace the Gorgan Scream, replace what code the animation calls for in the code, and then put the stanlter audio there

FSE and FSU, just credit and all that
