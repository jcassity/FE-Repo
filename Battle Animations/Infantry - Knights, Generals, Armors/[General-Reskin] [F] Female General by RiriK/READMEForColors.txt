****

All Colors that are not Main (1, 2, 16) are standalone and interchangable without affecting areas outside of what they're labeled for so there should be no color problem if you decide to use custom colors.

For 4-7 the color of the legs are together with the armor trimming so they will change together.

For 12-15 those are also used for the weapons coloring along with the armor. It is best suggested to keep the 4 pallets in the same spectrum for best possible outcome.

However because the colors are standalone it also mean that certain fixed colors based on a specific character's pallet (i.e Lyn's main class pallet) might not apply correctly without having to manually adjust it yourself.
