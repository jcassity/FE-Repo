For some reason, the other palettes will default back to the original(player) color for the rest if any change in color for the original is made through the battle animations. Just add the other three back into the other palette type to fix this.

****

All Colors that are not Main (1, 2, 16) are standalone and interchangable without affecting areas outside of what they're labeled for so there should be no color problem if you decide to use custom colors.

For 4-7 that is the color for the Horse as well as part of the weapon(mostly the bladed areas). 

For 8-10 it is highly suggested to leave those alone. Due to limitation of the 16 color palettes, the trimming also act as skin color and drastic color changes will cause strangeness in areas it might be connected to said skin. If it is needed to be modify, then it is suggested that #10 be lefted alone or at least be where the spectrum of color be based on.

For 11-13 those are also used for part of the weapons coloring along with the armor. It is best suggested to keep the 3 palettes in the same spectrum for best possible outcome.

However because the colors are standalone it also mean that certain fixed colors based on a specific character's palette (i.e Lyn's main class palette) might not apply correctly without having to manually adjust it yourself.
